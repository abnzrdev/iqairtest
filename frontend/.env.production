# .env.production
# Do NOT set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL to a Docker-internal hostname here.
# NEXT_PUBLIC_* values are baked into the client JS bundle at build time,
# so they must be resolvable by the browser (e.g. http://localhost:8000).
# When unset, lib/api.ts falls back to localhost (browser) or backend:8000 (SSR).
#
# Override at deploy time via docker-compose environment or .env:
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
